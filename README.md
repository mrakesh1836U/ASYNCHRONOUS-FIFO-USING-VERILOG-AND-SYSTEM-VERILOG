# ASYNCHRONOUS-FIFO-USING-VERILOG-AND-SYSTEM-VERILOG
An asynchronous FIFO in Verilog/SystemVerilog is a buffer that safely transfers data between two clock domains using dual-port memory, read/write pointers, and synchronization logic. It prevents metastability, ensuring reliable communication across different clock frequencies.
